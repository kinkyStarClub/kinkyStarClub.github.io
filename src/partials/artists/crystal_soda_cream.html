The band’s first long player ‘Escape from Vienna’ (Totally Wired Records) references the John Carpenter classic ‘Escape from New York’, and sees Crystal Soda Cream retreat to their own world of smoke machines, 80s sounds and political lyrics. Since 2012, Theresa, Sebastian and Philipp have been mining influences such as Siouxsie Sioux and The Birthday Party to create contemporary Post-Punk: minimalistic, cold and danceable.</p>
